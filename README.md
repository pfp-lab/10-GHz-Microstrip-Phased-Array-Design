# 10GHz Microstrip Phased Array Design

This repository chronicles the complete journey behind the design and simulation of a 10 GHz phased array antenna using microstrip technology. This is not just a final design file, but a step-by-step path demonstrating how a complex system is built from its simplest components.

The process starts with the fundamentals: the design of a single patch antenna, optimized with the inset feed technique. Subsequently, the focus shifts to the feed network, analyzing how to efficiently divide power first with a T-junction and then with 4-way power dividers, designed for both in-phase and phase-shifted outputs.

A crucial part of the project is dedicated to optimization. You will see the negative impact of discontinuities, such as 90-degree corners , and how a simple layout modification — chamfering — transforms a component with mediocre performance into a nearly ideal one, drastically improving impedance matching and signal stability.

The final result is the integration of all these elements into a 4-element phased array antenna, which is analyzed in detail for its performance in gain, bandwidth, and its radiation pattern. The entire project, simulated using Ansoft software, serves as a practical and comprehensive example for anyone studying or working with antennas and microwave circuits in the X-band.
